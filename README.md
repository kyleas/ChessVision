# ChessVision
This code allows a robot to play chess completely independent of human input (besides the human making their own move). The vision portion is based off of OpenCV and the chess portion requires stockfish to be installed on the raspberry pi (independent installation). There are calibration methods that calibrates the board location and the colors based off of images taken from the code. [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/2t4XxeOtrnI) detailing how my robot works

All code is complete garbage, but it's functional!
